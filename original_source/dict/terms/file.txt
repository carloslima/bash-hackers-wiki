====== File ======

A file is a pool of data in the [[dict:terms:filesystem | filesystem]]. On userlevel, it's referenced using a name, a [[dict:terms:hardlink | hardlink]] to the file.

If a file is not referenced anymore (number of hardlinks to it drops to 0) then the space allocated for that file is re-used, unless it's still used by some process.

The file-data splits into actual payload (file contents) and some metadata like filesize, filemode or timestamps. The metadata is stored in the [[dict:terms:inode | inode]].

Strictly spoken, a [[dict:terms:hardlink | hardlink]] (also called "filename") points to the [[dict:terms:inode | inode]] which organizes a file, not to the file itself.
