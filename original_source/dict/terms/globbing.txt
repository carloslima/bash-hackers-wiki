====== Globbing ======

Globbing is the procedure of
  * matching all filenames against a given pattern
  * expanding to all matching filenames

Unlike MSDOS, where the called program had to interpret the patterns, the globbing on UNIX(r) is done by the shell, the matched filenames are given as parameters to a called command:
<code>
$ cat *.txt
</code>
really executes
<code>
$ cat 1.txt 3.txt foobar.txt XXX.txt
</code>

The term "glob" originates back in the UNIX(r) days where an executable ''glob'' (from "global") existed which was used to expand pattern-matching characters. Later, this functionality was built into the shell. There's still a library function called ''glob()'' (POSIX(r)), which serves the same purpose.
