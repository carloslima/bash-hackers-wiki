====== Special file ======

Unlike a regular file (a bunch of accessible data organized on a filesystem), it's a special filename that points to a ressource or similar:
  * character special files
  * block special files
  * named pipes
  * socket files
Since a directory also is only a file, you can count it as special file, too.
