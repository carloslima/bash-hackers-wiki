====== Directory ======

In terms of UNIX(r), a directory is a special file which contains a list of [[dict:terms:hardlink | hardlinks]] to other files. These other files also can be directories of course, so it's possible to create a "hierarchy of directories" - the UNIX(r)-typical filesystem structure.

The structure begins at the special directory ''/'' (root directory) and all other directory entries are **subdirectories** of it.
