====== Bash Hackers Wiki needs love ======

There are things to do. Always.

===== Article optics and structure =====

Target: A more or less unique structure (done)

  * [[syntax:ccmd:intro]] - bring all mentioned compound command description pages into a format
    * SYNOPSIS
    * DESCRIPTION
      * (with as many sub-topics as needed)
    * EXAMPLES
    * PORTABILITY CONSIDERATIONS
    * SEE ALSO
  * do the same with command descriptions (printf, read, ...)


===== Article content and correctness =====

In general all pages need review, all the time. If you find anything incorrect, stupid, unclear, just edit the page or write a mail. It's also possible to use the integrated discussion option (below every article).

Specific needs:
  * [[scripting:tutoriallist]] - new tutorials? opinions? etc.

===== Article code examples =====
  * [[howto:getopts_tutorial]] - lacks some complex or more sophisticated examples

===== Article completeness =====
  * [[scripting:newbie_traps]] - add your personal top newbie traps
  * [[internals:shell_options]] - are these all options?
  * [[commands:builtin:printf]] - can printf do more?
  * [[syntax:shellvars]] - needs complete shell variables

===== Greg's BashFAQ mirror =====

The code rewrite to mirror Greg's BashFAQ was a bad idea, it doesn't work good. A fix to not lose the links would be to invent some nifty mod_rewrite rules to forward any requests to the namespace to the real BashFAQ wiki.

**Update:** Just hacked the rewrite rules - the mirror is gone and the mirror URLs redirect to Greg's BashFAQ.

**Future:** Mirror it as real MoinMoinWiki instance. This won't happen here on the webspace, more on a dedicated server.

===== Getopts tutorial =====

  * more examples
  * workaround to use long options: translate long option to short option and replace positional parameters before using getopts
