====== Bash compound commands ======

The main part of Bash's syntax are the so-called **compound commands**. They're called like that because they use "real" commands ([[syntax:basicgrammar#simple_commands | simple commands]] or [[syntax:basicgrammar#lists | lists]]) and knit some intelligence around them. That is what the essential "Bash language" is made of.

===== Command grouping =====
  * grouping: [[grouping_plain | command grouping]]
  * grouping again: [[grouping_subshell | command grouping in a subshell]]


===== Conditional reactions =====

Note that conditionals can also be scripted using [[syntax:basicgrammar#lists | list]], which are syntax elements, not commands.

  * the "new" test command: [[conditional_expression | conditional expression]]
  * if-clause: [[if_clause | conditional branching]]
  * case statement: [[case | pattern-based branching]]

===== Loops =====
  * [[classic_for | classic for-loop]]
  * [[c_for | C-style for-loop]]
  * [[while_loop | while loop]]
  * [[until_loop | until loop]]

===== Misc =====
  * math: [[arithmetic_eval | arithmetic evaluation]]
  * menus: [[user_select | user selections]]
