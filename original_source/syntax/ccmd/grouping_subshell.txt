====== Grouping commands in a subshell ======

===== Synopsis =====
<code>
( <LIST> )
</code>


===== Description =====
The [[syntax:basicgrammar#lists|list]] ''<LIST>'' is executed in a separate shell - a subprocess. No changes to the environment (variables etc...) are reflected in the "main shell".

===== Examples =====

Execute a command in a different directory.
<code bash>
echo "$PWD"
( cd /usr; echo "$PWD" )
echo "$PWD" # Still in the original directory.
</code>

===== Portability considerations =====

  * The subshell compound command is specified by POSIX.
  * Avoid ambiguous syntax.
<code bash>
(((1+1))) # Equivalent to: (( (1+1) ))
</code>
